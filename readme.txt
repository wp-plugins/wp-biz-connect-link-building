--------------------------------------------------------------
Setting up Your Links Page

Simply create a new page in WordPress. Call the page anything you want. 'Resources', 'external resources', 'recommended pages' are all fine names. We recommend you don't include the word 'links' in the page name.

Add the WP Biz Connect short code to the page which is:

[WPbizconnect_links]

If you're not familiar with WordPress short codes this is simply a special hook which WordPress uses to automatically display the content of the plugin on the page.
---------------------------------------------------------------



3.Lastly choose an appropriate niche for your site and click 'Save Changes'.



Bonus Links!

Any site which places a link from their homepage to the links page will receive  25% more links! We encourage this because links pages that are accessible from the homepage are more likely to generate traffic and increased Google authority for our programs users. It does not need to be blatantly obvious. You can place it in the footer of your site after your copyright notice, in the sidebar etc. etc.
